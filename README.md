# Digital-System-Design

Personal repository on studying digital design using verilog.

# Tools

## VS Code

## Icarus verilog

# Folder Structure

Inspired by _Directories Within the Project_[Ba21].

```
|-<project>
    |-hdl/
    |-test/
    |-simulation/
```

## hdl/

The HDL directory is where all hardware Verilog source \*.v files to be used for synthesis belong.

## test/

All Verilog testbenches for the design go into the "test" folder.

## simulation/

The main file in here is the wave files from icarus-verilog.
